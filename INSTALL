You can install and test this layout in a few steps:

# Download the layout:
wget https://github.com/infertux/bepode/blob/master/bepode \
    --no-check-certificate -O /tmp/bepode

# Move it into the right directory (must be root):
sudo mv /tmp/bepode /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

# Before actually switching to bepode layout, you may open another console that
# will help you return to your current layout:
setxkbmap -query | grep layout: | awk '{print $2}'
# It should display something like 'fr', thus:
setxkbmap fr # without hitting Enter!

# Now, go back in your previous console and type:
setxkbmap bepode

# Enjoy!
