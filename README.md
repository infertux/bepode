Why yet yet another fork of the Bépo layout?
============================================

Indeed, Bépo rules:
-------------------
- Dvorak way
- optimised for French typing

But, it also sucks:
-------------------
- not handy at all for English typing
    - `W` poorly placed
    - the typographic apostrophe `’` with `AltGr` [`FIXME`]
- not handy at all for programming
    - `<` & `>` with `AltGr`
    - `[` & `]` too far in the digits row + with `AltGr` [`FIXME`]
    - `/` too far in the digits row [`FIXME`]

That’s why I try some changes with _bepode_. Yeah, it’s an awful portmanteau
word between _bepo_ and _code_ and I haven’t taken the time to find a better
name for now.

__Disclaimer__: This layout is primarily designed for a
_TypeMatrix 2030 keyboard_ so it may not be optimised for a non ergonomic
staggered keyboard inherited from old writing machines ;).

Here are the differences with the official Bépo layout:
-------------------------------------------------------
- `<` & `>` swapped with `«` & `»`
- `w` key swapped with the `^` one
- to be continued…
